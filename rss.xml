            <description><![CDATA[<p>When I was nine, a jealous neighbor girl told me I had a terrible voice. After hearing that, having no reason not to believe her, I didn't sing for twenty years. Immidiately I started lip syncing in choir practice, sure that I was ruining the song for other kids... A few years ago i noticed this "you have a terrible voice" story I was carrying around and decided to drop it. I still probably have a "terrible voice" but I'm going to sing more and more. It makes me feel as good as jumping on the trampoline or snowboarding with people I love and respect. Here's to the journey.Â </p>]]></description>
